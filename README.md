# Mazebuilder

RandomMazeBuilder generates a maze using disjoint sets. The maze always has only one solution, all cells are reachable, and walls that allow cells to be reachable should be removed. Edges are generated in a random order and the starting point is always at the upper left corner and the ending point at the lower right corner.
